# Verification And Validation



it is important to firstly say that verification and validation are two forms of analysis that are not the same even if they may mostly be associated together in software engineering. 

According to Barry W. Boehm a distinguished Software Engineering professor "Software Validation is the process of ensuring that the Software is performing the right process while Software Verification is the process of ensuring that the software is performing the process right." He established this as "Verification: Are we building the product right?, Validation: Are we building the right product?"

What Barry W. Boehm teaches is that when it comes to Validation we are looking out for whether our software is doing the right thing as it is designed to by the software requirements, while Verification we are looking out for whether our software is correct based of the software requirements.

**Validation suggests questions like :**
- Are we building the right car?
- Are we building the right House?
- Are we cooking the right food?

**Verification suggests questions like: **
- Are we building the car correctly?
- Are we building the house correctly?
- Are we cooking the food correctly?

Validation and Verification stands on Software Engineering requirements, this is to say that the guideline and constraint to vet the process of validation and validation comes from Software Engineering requirements.

Both Validation and Verification are very important and so knowing their importance helps us understand them better.

**Advantages of Validation**

1. Verification at the early phase of project development help us to understand the product we are building as a whole in its entirety.
2. Verification helps build the product according and precisely how the customer needs and specify it to be.
3. Verification increases the chances of the success of your product and decresses the chances of failure of the product.
4. Verification decreases number of issuses that may be encountered in the later stages of development


**
Examples of Verification**
- Testing
- Inspection
- Design Analysis
- Specification Analysis
- Design Review 
- Code Walk-through
- Requirement for Business/Functionality 
- Code Inspection
- Test Plan Review (Internal to QA team)
- est Plan (external) 
- est documentation review
- est documentation final review 

All these are activities that checks and shows the quality of the software.

**Importance of Validation**
1. Validation helps us build the right product as precisely as the customer's requirements which will in turn satisfy their business process needs.
2. Validation is done during testing (e.g unit testing, integration testing, system testing, load testing, compatibility testing, stress testing, etc)
3. Validation exposes the defects and issues missed as failures during the verification process.
4. Validation reveals if specifications where skipped or misunderstood after development and this gives room for corrective actions to be taken. 


**Examples of Validation**

1.Unit Testing 

2.Testing for Integration

3.System Evaluation

4.Acceptance Testing of Users 

5.Load Testing

6.Compatibility Testing

7.Stress Testing

8.Feature Testing
