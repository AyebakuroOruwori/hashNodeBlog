# Requirement Engineering


*3 Fundamental Concepts in Requirements Engineering*
a. What are Requirements? 
b. Who are the stakeholders and what is their role in requirements?
c. What is their role in requirements engineering?

**
Requirements? **
	Examples of Personal Requirements 

is drinking water after getting out of bed every morning a requirement for you?

is having a phone with a good camera a good requirement for you?

is it a requirement that you get at least six hours of sleep every day?
   These are examples of requirements in our personal life.
   In a business context, a requirement is a condition needed by a user to solve a problem or achieve an objective.
    When we can understand what requirements are we can begin to understand who the stakeholders are, they are people or organizations that have an impact on our project. e.g Peter (The HR Manager) can be a stakeholder if we are working on a system that deals with human resources, or Judith (Chef) can be considered a stakeholder if we are working on a food management system. it is necessary to identify all the types of stakeholders as early as possible. Some stakeholders are called direct stakeholders, they are the people who will be directly impacted by the system or project we are implementing, they can be users of the system or their role in the organization could be affected by the implementation of the new system. on the other hand, some indirect stakeholders should know what is going on in our project but may not be directly impacted, they can include people from related business areas or even external parties that need to be considered. an example of an external stakeholder in the context of human resources would be the government policies around employee rights and regulations. So basically we can say that a Stakeholder of a system is a person that has a direct or indirect influence on the requirements of the system.
    Now that we know this what can we say is Requirements Engineering? Requirements Engineering is defined as a Systematic and disciplined approach to the specification and management of requirements with specific goals firstly knowing the relevant requirements achieving a consensus among the stakeholders about these requirements documenting them according to given standards and managing them systematically, the second goal of requirements in a way that minimizes the risk of delivering a system that does not meet their desires and needs then specifying and managing requirements to minimize the risk of delivering  a system that does not meet the cyclist desires and needs 
   
## **- Four Main Activities of Requirements Engineering **
 1. Elicitation 
 2. Documentation 
 3. Validation and Negotiation 
 4. Management 
 
 
 
 1. Elicitation: It is all about engaging with stakeholders to elicit and understand their business needs and requirements there are various requirements elicitation techniques that can be applied some of these techniques include requirements interviews and workshops.
 
 2. Documentation: It is all about capturing the requirements in a documented format that will make clear sense to the business stakeholders as well as the technical teams who may need your document your requirements must be clear complete and accurate
 
 3. Validation and Negotiation:  it is about making sure that what you have documented as requirements is valid and agreed upon by all stakeholders involved in this activity often involves clear communication and negotiation with stakeholders  
 
 4. Management: This involves managing any changes that might occur or arise regarding your requirements, the requirements engineer must learn to manage requirements systematically and transparently to ensure that changes are tracked efficiently and accurately. 
 
##  
** Constraints: **These are those limitations that have an impact on your requirements activities constraint can come in the form of people, business, rules, or organizational constraints. it is important to document the relevant constraints that you had to work within when you document your requirements.
